dict_check
===

A simple command line tool. You give it a password you believe to be compromised and a dictionary, database, or exposure list of passwords. If the password is in the list, it will find it. Very quickly. (Works best on solid state technology. If you need fastest possible put the dictionary on a RAMDisk).
